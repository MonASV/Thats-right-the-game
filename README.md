# TriviaDos Sprint



## The Project:

After two weeks of intensive training at Ironhack, all concepts learned have to come into practice!

### The guidelines:

Create a browser-based game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).



## The game:

A trivia game about general topics and a bonus of JavaScript!

### How to play?

- Go to the game: https://monasv.github.io/Thats-right-the-game

- Once you land in the Home Page, you will see nine game categories. You can choose one by clicking on it.

- You will see cards containing questions. At the right side of the screen, you will see all the possible answers.

- It's recommended to quickly read all the possible answers first, and then start to read the questions. 

- Once you know the answer for a question, all you need to do is to drag it and drop it on your card. 

- Once you are finished, you can submit your answers by clicking on the "Review" button.

- Your right answers are turning green and your wrong or not answered questions will turn red. You will also see the points you collected.

- When you get the results, you will have the option to play again, or to try another sprint. 


### Game Rules:

- Once you are in your desired Trivia, the sprint starts: you've only got two minutes to prove your knowledge!

- There is only one right answer for each question. 

- Each correct answered question gives you a point.

- Maximal points per category : 9.

- You decide whit how many points you win!



### Keep in mind:

It's highly recommended to activate the music for the game. The music running in the background it's going to stop once you have 15 seconds remaining. A new sound will accompany you during the last seconds of the game.
